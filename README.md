# Cross-chapter-TidyTuesday
This repository is for the May event, Cross chapter Tidy Tuesday. You are welcome to post your code-along solutions from the event here.

TidyTuesday is a weekly event created by the Data Science Learning Community for folks to develop new skills in a low-stakes, welcoming environment. Each week, a new dataset is released for everyone to play and explore. There is no limit to what you can do! You can produce a nice-looking table, or a story-telling graphic, perhaps even an intuitive Shiny interface â€“ the choice is yours!

Please not that this event will not be recorded. Kindly code along to ensure you make the most out of the session!
